## 🧭 How to Use This Roadmap

Follow these steps to start learning Dart with this roadmap:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Kr3artive/dart-beginners-roadmap.git

2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code).

   Follow the learning order by opening the Dart files in sequence. Each file covers a specific concept:
   
   variables.dart → Learn how to declare and use variables in Dart and Understand Dart’s basic types like int, double, String, bool, etc..
   
   lists.dart → Explore lists and how to store multiple items.
   
   maps.dart → Learn key-value pairs with Dart maps.
   
   loops.dart → Practice repetition using for, while, and do-while loops.
   
   logic.dart → Master conditional statements (if-else, switch) and logical operators.
   
   functions.dart → Understand functions, parameters, and return values.
   
   input.dart → Learn how to take input from users in the console.
   
   convertingDatatypes.dart → Practice converting between different data types (e.g., String ↔ int).

3. To run the Dart code in each file to see examples in action:
   ```bash
      dart run <filename>.dart e.g dart run variables.dart
